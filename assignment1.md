### Summary
Throughout completing this assignment, I didn't have too many issues however learning about running GitHub actions in series and automating deploys to dockerhub, I have already started implimenting this into my other school assignments and personal projects. The SSH tunnel is also very useful as I didn't totally apprecate its power.
I will be setting up a Github Actions container on my homelab when I get home and start adding my personal projects to this as well.
